The code for grayhole attack is there in 'grayhole' folder:

aodv.cc and aodv.h : Copy these in the folder 'ns-allinone-2.35 -> ns-2.35 -> aodv'. Then run the following commands on the terminal after chenging directory to 'ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35' --
			make clean
			make
			sudo make install
aodvb.tcl : Contains the topology and ns2 simulation. Place it anywhere and run by typing 'ns aodvb.tcl' on the terminal.



The code for rushing attack is there in 'rushing' folder:
